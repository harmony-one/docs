SubQuery stands out as a top-tier blockchain data indexer, offering developers swift, adaptable, all-encompassing, open-source, and decentralized APIs tailored for web3 projects. With the SubQuery SDK, developers can access comprehensive indexed data, enabling them to construct decentralized applications with greater speed and efficiency. Notably, SubQuery extends support to over 100 ecosystems, encompassing Harmony, Ethereum, Polygon, Polkadot, Algorand, NEAR, and Avalanche.

One of SubQuery's key strengths lies in its capability to aggregate data not only within a single chain but also across diverse blockchains seamlessly integrated into a unified project. This unique feature empowers the creation of sophisticated dashboard analytics and versatile multi-chain block scanners.

Additionally, SubQuery boasts superior performance, thanks to its support for multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities, and a configurable caching architecture. For more in-depth information, explore our [documentation](https://academy.subquery/).
